Performance Comparison:
    Data Set: Consider a sorted array of size 𝑛
    Scenario: Searching for a specific element.

        1) Small Data Sets (n is small):
            Both linear search and binary search are feasible. However, binary search, 
            despite its logarithmic time complexity, might not show significant performance
            advantages over linear search due to the small size of the dataset.
            
        2) Large Data Sets (n is large):
            Linear Search: Performs linear scans through the array, which can be inefficient
              for large datasets, especially when the element is towards the end or not present.
            Binary Search: Shows significant performance benefits due to its logarithmic time complexity. 
              It efficiently reduces the search space with each comparison, making it much faster than linear 
              search for large datasets.

        3) Impact of Sorting:
            Binary Search: Requires the array to be sorted beforehand. Sorting takes 𝑂(𝑛log𝑛)
                time complexity in itself. Once sorted, binary search is 𝑂(log𝑛).
            Linear Search: Works efficiently on unsorted arrays but operates in 𝑂(𝑛)
                time complexity regardless of the order.
